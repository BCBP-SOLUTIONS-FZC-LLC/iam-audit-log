# Cross-compiles release binaries for all target platforms and writes
# per-binary checksums. The artifact directory is the working directory
# when this runs.
#
# This service ships TWO binaries from one image (see Dockerfile / Makefile's
# `build` target) — /iam-audit-log-server (query + ingest API and the 11-queue
# SQS consumer fleet) and /iam-audit-log-reconciler (archival / partition /
# prune CronJobs, dispatched via --job=<name>). Both are cross-compiled here, per
# platform, mirroring the Makefile's own build target's -ldflags convention.
#
# Produces for each platform x binary:
#   iam-audit-log-server_{version}_{os}_{arch}[.exe]
#   iam-audit-log-server_{version}_{os}_{arch}[.exe].sha256
#   iam-audit-log-reconciler_{version}_{os}_{arch}[.exe]
#   iam-audit-log-reconciler_{version}_{os}_{arch}[.exe].sha256
#
# The caller (create-github-release.sh) aggregates all the non-.sha256 files
# into a single checksums.txt with
# `sha256sum iam-audit-log-* | grep -v '\.sha256$'`.
#
# This service is deployed exclusively as a container (README § Docker) —
# these binaries are a convenience for local/non-Docker runs, not the
# primary distribution artifact (that's the signed GHCR image, which
# carries both entrypoints already).
#
# Note: cmd/reconciler/main.go has no `buildVersion` package variable (only
# cmd/server/main.go does), so -X main.buildVersion=... is a silent no-op
# for the reconciler binary today — same as the Makefile's own `build`
# target, which applies the identical flag to both for consistency. Not
# changed here; that's a pre-existing repo quirk, not a release-workflow
# concern.
